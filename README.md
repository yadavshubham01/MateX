Creating an app where people can post their project requirements, connect with others by liking or messaging posts, and form teams to work on projects sounds like a great idea.

Core Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and create profiles.
Posting Requirements: Users can create posts describing their project requirements.
Like/Message Posts: Users can like posts and send messages to the post owners.
Team Building: Users can express interest in joining a project, and the post owner can accept or reject requests.
User Roles: There could be two types of users:
Post Creators: People who post their project requirements.
Collaborators: People who join projects or contribute.
Notifications: Notify users when someone likes, comments, or sends a message about their post.
Real-time Messaging: Allow users to chat with each other in real time to discuss the project.
